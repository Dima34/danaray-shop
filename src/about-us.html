                    <p>“DenaRay Essentials is named in memory of my grandmother, 
                        Dena Ray Evans. She taught me selflessness, sentiment, and how 
                        to appreciate my beautifully melanated skin. These principles have helped me grow into the woman I am today and reflect everything DenaRay Essentials stands for.”</p>
